Today’s more advanced technologies are furthering our goals and helping with automation in every field making the need for a human in those areas invalid, because a human is prone to making mistakes, but a machine in his/her place would certainly be more efficient, both in terms of speed and accuracy. Technologies such as Deep Learning and Machine Learning have evolved greatly in this time.

This technology helps to teach machines to learn on their own instead of having to program every single action and possibility. So, this project helps us to use techniques like this such as convolution neural networks, keras, Tensorflow, etc. and implement them so as to help the self-driving cars to be able to perceive traffic signs and react according to the input received.
